# Cohort_Analysis_using_python
Cohort Analysis performed on data to find any trends in user engagement based on different factors. Originally from "60+ Data Analysis Projects with Python" by Aman Kharwal .

## Introduction
Cohort Analysis is a data analysis technique used to gain insights into the behaviour and characteristics of specific groups of users or customers over time. It is valuable for businesses as it allows them to understand user behaviour in a more granular and actionable way.
- In this project, tried understanding the trends in new v.s returning users over time, and trends in weekly activities of users, by plotting line graphs
- Studied the correlations between different variables by plotting a heatmap of the correlation.
- Also studied the weekly average of different factors by performing cohort analysis on them, and understanding the user engagement patterns over a duration of time.

## Packages Used:
pandas, matplotlib.pyplot, plotly, seaborn
